This package contains a single component 'TypeFlow' which aims to provide a wrapper for any given HTML element that has text within it. It takes the text and applies a typing effect to it. It has some configuration for the speed of the effect, as well as the ability to control pauses for individual characters (i.e punctuation).

There is some variable delay on the effect for every character, with more randomisation on spaces and longer delays on puctuation.
